# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git stands for global information tracker. It is a local repository that is located in our computers. Our files are tracked on our computer only. Acts as a source control so that we can keep a history of updates to our file. And reverse any changes made.

Github lets us work/help each other in a remote enviorment. It is a remote repository. We can create a copy of the main branch in order to make changes before merging it to the main branch.  It gives us a history of all changes when we commit/merge. We can reverse changes made to our main branch if needed. It makes coding collaboration more efficient. With failsafes.

Researched answer:

Git is a free, version control source system. Git stands for Global information tracker. It allows developers to have a local repository where they can keep a history of changes made to their files. Changes can be reverted through this. It allows us to collaborate with others dev by uploading changes and also getting files from other through the terminal.

Github is a version control source system that works as remote repository for collborators. It allows for developers to work on a project. We can build up different parts of a project at the same time using duplicate branches. We can then merge changes to the main branch, while also being able to revert those changes.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Logical/comparison/equality 
Comparison
>
<
<=
>=

Logical OR ||
Logical Not !

Equality
=== Strict equality
== Loose equality

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: In an Array each value has a location called the index. The value is the data located at the index inside of an Array. 

Researched answer:
Indexes are numbers that give us a location or value that is being stored at that location. They are are zero-indexed meaning they begin counting from 0 and not 1. We can use this to access information in a string or array. In order to access them we must use the bracket notation []. You can input the value which is the data located at the index or the index (0,1,2, etc.) which is the location.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Repeating a certain criteria until it is met.

Researched answer:
In Javascript Loops an iteration is used in statements where a process is repeated a number of times until a condition is met.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
There is a navigator and driver. The driver will be the one typing the code and will be told what to do by the navigator. The navigator is responsible for making sure the instructions are being said to the driver. They navigator will essentially build up the code but isn't the one to type it.

Researched answer: 
In pair programming there is a driver and navigator. A driver and and navigator work together to build code. The driver will listen to instructions give by the navigator and produce the code. In order for the two to be efficient they must communicate effectively. This can mean building a plan together and making sure there is a understanding of what is to be done. Working with another person creates efficiency with the knowledge of both people. It also helps with keeping focus on the task as both people should be engaged. But a driver should not be the one to code on their own with no guidance. There should be respect between the two of proper workload balance. If there is an issue of not knowing what to for the navigator, they will have a driver to properly work through it with.
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
You are able to pass function into a variable. This mean you can pass a function into a parameter or we can receive the output as a function. This creates a high order function.
2. Jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. It allows to test code in order look for bugs, refactor code safely.
3. Objects:
Objects are a variable that can have several values input in them. Values are written as name:value pairs. These are called properties.
4. Method:
Methods are actions we can perform on an object.
5. Classes:
It is a blueprint for creating objects. We can use methods to tell it what the object will look like. But the class does not give it a value, the object itself would.
